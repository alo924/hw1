This webpage would provide detail on a business called "Flying Solo" that enables travelers to order individually-sized snacks, with options to customize by diet, for pick-up at an airport kiosk prior to the flight. This service alleviates the need to purchase multi-person sized snacks that are typically found at airport shops (e.g., Hudson News).
